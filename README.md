# BMI Calculator README

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows users to input their weight and height in various units (kilograms, pounds, meters, feet, inches) and calculates their BMI, providing a humorous and lighthearted interpretation of the result.
